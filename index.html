      <h1>TEXAS, NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA LEAD COUNTRY IN EXONERATIONS, BUT EXPERTS SAY IT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG</h1>
      <h2>By Jeff Winter</h2>

      <p>The National Registry of Exonerations collects information on every state and federal exoneration in the United States since 1989.</p>
      <p>The Registry provides “comprehensive information on exonerations of innocent criminal defendants in order to prevent future false convictions by learning from past errors,” according to its mission statement.</p>
      <p>“Exonerations are the closest thing we’ve got about how many people have been wrongfully convicted. But it’s really the tip of the iceberg,” said Professor Barbara O’Brien, editor of the Exoneration Registry.</p>
      <p>According to Registry data, Texas leads the U.S. in exonerations with 384, followed by New York's 279 and California's 205.</p>
      <p>From the county of occurence to years between conviction and exoneration, the Registry's database allows researchers to examine and study variables in each of the cases it monitors.</p>
      <p>“They really should be recognized as the preeminent institution systemically tracking wrongful convictions as they are revealed,” said Rebecca Brown, policy director at the Innocence Project.</p>
